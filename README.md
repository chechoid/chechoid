I'm a HR professional living for making changes in how we manage people at work through data, in a highly ethical, and innovative way.

This is where you may find and know my learning path, in which you'll get to know my mental mess and see my learning curve from my initial projects, to more organized ones.

Appart from my jobs at Data 4HR, Data IQ, and ITBA, I'm also leading a learning community for HR professionals in Spanish speaking countries who want to learn how to code, called [R4HR Club de R para RRHH](https://r4hr.netlify.app).
